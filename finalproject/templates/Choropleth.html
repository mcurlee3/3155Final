            <p>This visualization gives you the ability to view of the happiness of countries surveyed on a broad scale. The countries that are the happiest are highlighted by the yellow color and the less happy countries are colored purple. The countries that were not included in the survey do not have a coloration. If you want to see a specific country's happiness score a quick hover over the country will give you access.</p>
