            <p>Happiness is a basic right of all the world’s citizens. Happiness may be different, however depending on the individual. This is why we at Happy Home decided to create tools that allow any individual to find his own notion of Happiness. At Happy Home we do not claim to corner the market on happiness, we just find the right source of happiness worldwide and then we make the world smaller.</p>
            <p class="mb-0">Our customer is any citizen that wishes to gather information on the overall that COVID-19 had on the feeling of happiness by country throughout the world. Our focus will be both on those who wish to find a new place to live based on their own qualifiers and those who wonder about how people in other countries perceive their own lives. </p>
